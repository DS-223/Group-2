# Notebook – Result Analysis (SmartCRM)

This notebook (`result_analyses.ipynb`) is used for exploratory data analysis, validation of generated data, and visual summaries of customer behavior. It complements the backend analytics and serves as a lightweight environment for prototyping data science logic.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Validate synthetic data generated by the ETL service
- Plot and explore RFM metrics, customer activity, and ordering behavior
- Serve as a scratchpad for experimentation before productionization

## 🧰 Libraries Used

- `pandas` – DataFrame manipulation
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – Visualizations
- `sqlalchemy` or CSV readers – For loading data
- `jupyter` – Notebook interface

## 📈 Example: RFM Segment Distribution

```python
rfm_df["segment"].value_counts().plot(kind="bar", color="skyblue")
plt.title("Customer Segment Distribution")
```

---

## 🧪 Typical Questions Explored

- What are the average spend profiles by segment?
- Which menu items dominate specific time windows?
- Are segments consistent with business intuition?

---

## 🧠 Notes

- This notebook is not part of the production pipeline
- Used primarily by data scientists for analysis and visual validation
- Insights from here may be upstreamed into `modeling.py` or `recomendation.py`
